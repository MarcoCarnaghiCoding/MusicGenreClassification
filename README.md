# MusicGenreClassification


The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks every 30 seconds in duration. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are 16-bit monophonic audio files at 22050Hz in .wav format. Your task is to extract audio features and create a model capable of classifying tracks by genre using these features. You may find this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/blob/master/3_MidtermProjects/ProjectGTZ/additional/Test_Audio.ipynb.ipynb) useful for opening and exploring audio tracks. For this project, try to put more emphasis on the feature extraction side than on the classifier model. More information [here](https://www.kaggle.com/carlthome/gtzan-genre-collection).

The analysis will be performed using the following techniques:
* Clustering
* SVM
* ROM
* Deep Neural Networks
